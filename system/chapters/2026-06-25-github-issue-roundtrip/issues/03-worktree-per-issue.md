## Context (cold-start)

The Ralph Loop runs `--issue N` in the repo's working directory. Each `claude -p` step operates on that one tree. As of 2026-06-25 two issues cannot run without colliding, and a half-built issue contaminates `git status`.

## Problem

There is no isolation. Concurrent or back-to-back issue runs trample each other's working tree; a crashed run leaves the main tree dirty. This blocks any multi-issue capability (Swarm, Idea 5) and makes Round Trip branches messier than they need to be.

## Proposed mechanism

The filesystem-native take on sandcastle's "branch" strategy — using the tool the loop already trusts, `git worktree`:

1. At the start of an issue run: `git worktree add ../ralph-issue-N ralph/issue-N` (branch from default-branch HEAD).
2. Every `claude -p` step for that issue runs with cwd set to the worktree; the diff, the `feat(N.x):` commits, and the `git log` completion greps all scope to that tree automatically.
3. **Teardown / reaper:** on success, leave the branch for review and `git worktree remove`; on crash, an `EXIT` trap plus `git worktree prune` reclaims leaked trees.
4. **Artifact seam (decide explicitly):** keep planning artifacts (`docs/…`) discoverable in the main tree while code work happens in the worktree (symlink or write-through), so a viewer can still `cat docs/epics/issue-N.md`.

**Files touched:** `scripts/ralph-loop.sh` (run setup/teardown + cwd handling for each `claude -p` invocation).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] An issue run executes entirely inside `../ralph-issue-N`; the main working tree's `git status` stays clean throughout.
- [ ] Completion checks (`is_story_complete` / `git log` greps) remain correct when run from the worktree.
- [ ] **Reaper:** a crashed/interrupted run leaves no orphaned worktree or dangling branch after the next run's prune (verified by a smoke that simulates an abort).
- [ ] Planning artifacts remain readable from the main tree (the artifact seam is implemented, not hand-waved).
- [ ] Behavior with worktrees disabled is unchanged (feature flag or default-path parity).
- [ ] `prd.md` §3 Idea 3 matches shipped behavior (anti-drift DoD).

## Dependencies & sequencing

- **Blocked by:** The Round Trip (Idea 1) — branches/PRs define the branch a worktree checks out.
- **Blocks:** Swarm + Mission Control (Idea 5) — concurrency stands on per-issue isolation.

## Out of scope

Parallel execution / scheduling (Idea 5), sandboxing beyond git worktrees (no Docker/microVM — that is the explicit non-goal vs sandcastle; the loop stays bash + filesystem), the PR body content (Idea 2).

## Glossary

**Worktree** — a second working directory attached to the same git repository, checked out to its own branch (`git worktree`). **Reaper** — cleanup that removes leaked worktrees/branches after a crash. **Artifact seam** — the boundary where planning docs (main tree) and code (worktree) meet; a known place demos break if mishandled.
